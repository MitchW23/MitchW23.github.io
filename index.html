  <h1> My First Guitar</h1>
  <body>
    <p>I recently decided to embark on the journey of <strong>learning guitar.</strong> 
      It is something I have always wanted to do and really just never had the time to do so.<br>
      Looking to eventually learn to play <strong>rock</strong> and <strong>metal</strong> music, 
      I decided to go with an electric guitar. A prodiment brand that is used for this type of music is <strong>Ibanez.</strong><br>
      So I decided that was a good starting point. Ended up getting the <strong>Ibanez Gio GRX70QA</strong> 
      which is a really cheap starting guitar.<br> I thought this guitar really looked cool and wanted to be able to play on it, 
      and it did not break the bank like most guitars would.<br> If you are interested in looking at this guitar I would have you 
      checkout the <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/GRX70QATKS--ibanez-gio-series-grx70qa-transparent-black-sunburst" 
      title="Sweetwater - buy Ibanez Gio GRX70QA Electric Guitar" target="_blank">Sweetwater</a> page I got it from.
